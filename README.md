# BIPs
This project is my implementation of BIPs that were important to me. Here
you'll see BIP32, BIP39, BIP44, BIP49, BIP84, BIP141, that are useful for
address generation in almost ANY coin blockchain. You can use it to generate
mnemonics, generate addresses for Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero and etc.

## Usage

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
